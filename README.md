# the-storyverse-project

## Intro > POC
This is an initial POC version of a project to learn and apply new things to a book-related topic.

* Idea(s) For Book-Related Topic
    * the 'multiverse' of specific fictional books - the original book, books that are retellings or inspired by the original, books that reference the original, related non-fiction (author biography, literary criticism/analysis, etc); potentially also include film/tv adaptations
        * 2 initial ideas: Anne of Green Gables, Pride and Prejudice (two of my favorites, and ones that I have 'related' books on in my personal library)

* Areas of 'new things' to apply
    * library science/info science concepts - taxonomies and folksonomy - combining existing structured information with user-generated information for multi-dimensional view
    * using Obsidian for organize/maintain/etc the content (books and related tags/properties/etc)
    * using LLM(s)  (e.g., Claude ) - in designing the approach and design; potentially to be able to apply prompts to the data/content
