# the-storyverse-project

Obsidian Vault used to maintain 'catalog' for this project. 
+ Obsidian is the 'front end' to add and update the metadata and information. Obsidan supports easy tags and tag hierarchies which supports standardized values. 
+ The content can be formatted and exported via DataView to support various output formats.

The content is the 'multiverse' of specific fictional books (aka the 'storyverse') - the original book, books that are retellings or inspired by the original, books that reference the original, related non-fiction (author biography, literary criticism/analysis, etc), film/tv adaptations.
